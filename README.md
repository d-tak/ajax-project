# thinking-thoughts

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project.
In what is perhaps one of the most digitally connected eras known to human kind, people are often heard talking about feelings of isolation. The purpose of this simple application is to provide a randomized, inspirational quote that will encourage users to use the text field to "soundboard" their thoughts - wins, losses, joys, frustrations, etc. - with the option to save and return to their entries - or simply "like" the quote without saving their thoughts.
